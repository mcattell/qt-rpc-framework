rpc-project consists of two libraries and a tool called roc. The client can be bound to the server on the relevant, user determined port and for a specific instance of a QObject subclass. The object name is used to generate a unique ID which is then used by the client to connect signals on QObjects in the client application to slots on the remote object. Another pure RPC mode is available for which a pre-compilation code modifying tool “roc” is provided. Essentially, you can take any QObject subclass, run it through roc to generate a local stub object. Any calls to methods with the Q_INVOKABLE tag will then be forwarded synchronously or asynchronously to the real object, registered with the server.
